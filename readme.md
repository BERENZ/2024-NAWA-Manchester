## About the project

The project aims to develop new estimators for non-probability samples suffering from mis-classification error with an application to online job advertisements. New estimators of population means/totals will be proposed based on the literature on measurement error and state-of-the-art estimators such as mass imputation, inverse probability weighting or doubly robust estimators. The results of the project will include theory, simulation studies and novel job vacancy statistics based on the integrated online and survey data.

## Outputs

### Simulation Studies

-   Simulation based on the book "Handbook of web surveys (10.2)" ([initial results here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BERENZ/2024-NAWA-Manchester/blob/main/project/02-handbook-of-web-surveys-2.html))

-   initial simulation for MC-SIMEX approach ([initial results here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BERENZ/2024-NAWA-Manchester/blob/main/project/01-basic-sims.html))

### Presentations

-   [talk](presentations/manchester_seminar_nawa.pdf) at the Social Statistics Demography Workshop -- 19 June 2024 University of Manchester
